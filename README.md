# SeatReservationProject
 This project demonstrates a mini seat reservation project that could serve as a movie theatre seat reservation system or scaled to a large plane. 
 It uses a limited but functional GUI to provide a visual understanding of how the seats are being prepared.

- Seating Manipulation (seat cannot be reserved if its not empty)
